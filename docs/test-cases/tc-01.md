# [TC-01] : Retrieve accounts with allowed consent

### Precondition

A consent with allowed `ACCOUNTS_READ` permission.

### Assumptions

* The access token must be sent in the request header.
* The access token scope type should be `accounts`.
* The consentId must be sent in the scope of the access token.

## Test Steps

1. Send GET request to `/accounts/v1/accounts`.
2. Verify response status code is 200 (OK).
3. Assert returned JSON data contains expected accounts information.

## Expected Result

The data should be returned according to the schema:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "bank": "string",
      "accountNumber": "string",
      "creationDateTime": "2024-05-23T01:56:51."
    }
  ]
}
```
